***WIP***  
Development ongoing. AS-IS it _should_ fetch battery percentage, simulate mowing with a fan accessory, and provide an "on/off"-switch for toggling auto/home.

Config as below:  

{  
	"accessory": "HomebridgeRobonect",  
	"name": "name-of-your-mower",  
	"mower": "Mower make",  
	"model": "Mower Model",  
	"robonect-card": "H30x or HX",  
	"serial-number": "Serialnr of your mower",  
	"getUrl": "http://USER:PASS@SERVER:PORT"  
}  
  


*Note* If you have a Robonect HX, input "HX" in capitals. There's an extra accessory for you. :)
